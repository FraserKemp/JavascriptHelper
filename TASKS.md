1. Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10 - Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands. While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you could output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.


2. Create a length converter function - handles conversion from kilometers to miles. The function should include the input in kilometers and return the answer in miles. 1.60 km  = 1 mile


3. Calculate the sum of numbers within an array - Create a function that Takes an array of numbers e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and returns a sum of all numbers


4. Create a function that filters out negative numbers - Create a function that takes an array as an input and returns an array with all the negative numbers removed
